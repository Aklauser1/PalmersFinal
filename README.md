# PalmersFinal
# This is the final project I submitted for my python class in the fall of 2018. 
# We had to create a program that based on the fruit a user selected, would return a random fruit variant for each day of a given month. It could not repeat any fruit for a day in the month. Please make sure to download all files before running the program.
